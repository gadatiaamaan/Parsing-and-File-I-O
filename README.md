# Program Overview

The purpose of this program is to demonstrate file input/output (I/O) operations and parsing in C++ using the `fstream` library. The program reads data from an input file, performs calculations based on the input, and writes the results to an output file.

## Functionality

The program reads from an input file named "input.txt" and processes each line according to the specified format. Each line in the input file consists of three integers separated by commas, followed by a string. The integers are summed, and the subsequent string is written to the output file multiple times, based on the sum of the integers.

For example:
```
1,2,3
ham
```
becomes:
```
ham,ham,ham,ham,ham,ham
```

## Input File Format

The input file "input.txt" follows a specific format:
- Each line contains three integers separated by commas, followed by a string.
- The integers represent values to be summed.
- The string is the content to be repeated in the output file.

## Output File Format

The output file "output.txt" contains comma-separated strings based on the sum of integers from each line of the input file.

# Technologies, Algorithms, and Concepts

## File Input/Output (I/O)

File I/O operations involve reading data from and writing data to files on a computer's filesystem. In this program, file I/O is used to read input from "input.txt" and write output to "output.txt" using `ifstream` and `ofstream` classes from the `fstream` library.

## String Manipulation

String manipulation involves modifying, parsing, and formatting strings in a program. Here, string manipulation is performed using string streams (`istringstream`, `ostringstream`) to extract integers and strings from input lines, and to format output strings before writing to the output file.

## Error Handling

Error handling is the process of anticipating and handling errors that may occur during program execution. In this program, error handling is implemented to check if the input and output files are successfully opened. If opening fails, appropriate error messages are displayed to the user.

## Looping and Iteration

Looping and iteration are fundamental programming concepts used to execute a block of code repeatedly. Loops are used in this program to iterate through each line of the input file, perform calculations, and write output to the output file.
